# Air Quality Index SPA
Single page application to show air quality index of major cities in India. 

![DEMO GIF](https://realtime-aqi.netlify.app/demo-webpage.gif)

The page shows real time aqi levels of 12 metropolitan cities in India. The data keeps on updating every second.

The comparison between the aqi-levels of different cities is also shown by plotting the data on bar graphs. The aqi-levels are color coded for ease to understand the quality of air. To see the changes in aqi levels of specific city line chart is plotted.

To create the charts graphing library Recharts was used. Apart from that the entire design of the webpage has been done using vanilla html and scss.


What can be done to enhance the usage of application?

I would like to create a backend for the appplication that can store data for past 24 hours to make the application more useful.
